# Testing Healthcat

## Test Summary
`buildpods.sh` creates POD_TOTAL number of Pods and Services. Most of the Pods will have `/healthz` nginx configuration while some small number of Pods will be deployed withour the `/healthz` endpoint.

CHC should be able to detect both types of Pods - with and without health check, and provide the corresponding status.

<br />

## Test CHC

Find below the steps needed to spin up a test environment on your local workspace.

<br />

### Deploy k8s Kind cluster

For more details see https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/

Make sure your current terminal directory is set to `./tests/k8s`.

Check kind clusters:
```bash
kind get clusters
```

<br />

Create a cluster called `nginx` if missing using the `Kind` config files.

There are two Kind config files:
1. multi-node cluster - kind/Cluster-multi-nodes-1.17
   One control plane and 2 worker nodes.
2. single-node cluster - kind/Cluster-single-node-1.17
   Control plane node only

>The single node cluster is faster to spin. But you might create the cluster that best suit your needs.

>It's recommended that you keep the name `nginx` as it might be used elsewhere.

<br />

Issue the following command to spin up a single node cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster --name nginx \
  --config kind/Cluster-single-node-1.17
```

<br />

If something similar to the following output is printed out you are good to go:
```
Creating cluster "nginx" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.17.11) üñº
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ
Set kubectl context to "kind-nginx"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-nginx

Have a nice day! üëã
```

<br />

Inspect `kind-nginx` context
```bash
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-nginx
```

<br />

Expected output similar to:
```
Kubernetes master is running at https://127.0.0.1:54687
KubeDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:54687/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```

<br />

### Prepare the runtime environment for deploying the test resources

Create the necessary namespaces for CHC and Nginx tests pods:
```bash
kubectl create ns healthcat \
  && kubectl create ns nginx
```

<br />

Create the ConfigMap with additional Nginx config that includes
the liveness probe:
```bash
kubectl -n nginx apply -f configmap.yaml
```

<br />

### Deploy CHC

From the root directory of the `healthcat` (`../../`) from the current context) project, build and deploy using the make command:
```bash
make docker-kind
```

<br />

### Create pods manifests

Modify `POD_TOTAL` var if necessary, and then run `./build-pods.sh` script from the `./tests/k8s` directory. The resulting k8s manifest will contain the Pods and Services required for the test.

An example. Create 10 tests Pods.
```bash
./build-pods.sh 10
```
The output should look like:
```
<suppressed>
 SLEEP_TIME:
 POD_TOTAL: 10
 IS_HEALTH: notok
 POD_TEST_FILE: pods-test.yaml
 NOTOK_THRESHOLD: 1
Removing file pods-test.yaml ...
Creating Pod# 1
Creating Pod# 2
Creating Pod# 3
Creating Pod# 4
Creating Pod# 5
Creating Pod# 6
Creating Pod# 7
Creating Pod# 8
Creating Pod# 9
Creating Pod# 10
```

<br />

Manually apply the manifest created by the `./build-pods.sh` script:
>Always use a temporary namespace to be able to clean up tests resources easily.

```bash
kubectl apply -n nginx -f pods-test.yaml
```

The output should look like:
```
pod/nginx-1 created
service/nginx-1 created
pod/nginx-2 created
service/nginx-2 created
pod/nginx-3 created
service/nginx-3 created
pod/nginx-4 created
service/nginx-4 created
pod/nginx-5 created
service/nginx-5 created
pod/nginx-6 created
service/nginx-6 created
pod/nginx-7 created
service/nginx-7 created
pod/nginx-8 created
service/nginx-8 created
pod/nginx-9 created
service/nginx-9 created
pod/nginx-10 created
service/nginx-10 created
```

<br />

Check the number of Pods with a `/healthz` endpoint
```bash
kubectl -n nginx get pods -l health=ok
```

In this example all pods are healthy:
```
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-1    1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-10   1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-2    1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-3    1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-4    1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-5    1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-6    1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-7    1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-8    1/1     Running   0          30s
nginx-9    1/1     Running   0          30s
```

<br />

Check the number of Pods without a `/healthz` endpoint
```bash
kubectl -n nginx get pods -l health=notok
```

In this example the output is empty:
```
No resources found in nginx namespace.
```

<br />

Start the port proxy tunnel to expose the CHC endpoint as a localhost:
```bash
kubectl -n chc \
  port-forward $(kubectl get pods -n healthcat -l app=healthcat -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:80
```

<br />

Check the `/services` and `/status` API endpoints from CHC.

Hit the `/services` endpoint in order to get the JSON body containing both the cluster and services status.
```bash
 curl -s http://localhost:8080/services | jq .
```

The output should look similar to this:
```json
{
   "cluster": {
     "name": "dev",
     "healthy": true,
     "total": 10,
     "failed": 0
   },
   "services": [
     {
       "name": "nginx-9",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-1",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-4",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-8",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-6",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-7",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-10",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-2",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-3",
       "healthy": true
     },
     {
       "name": "nginx-5",
       "healthy": true
     }
   ]
 }
```

<br />

Hit the `/status` endpoint in order to get the success response "OK" of code `200`.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/status
```

<br />

### Cleanup
```bash
kind delete cluster --name nginx
```
